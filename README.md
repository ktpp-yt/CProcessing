# CProcessing

Just processing, but in C++ <br>
Most sketches are compatible, but library not fully ported

Currently move to own OpenGL renderer

# Dependencies

 - OpenGL (GL/glew.h)
 - GLFW (GLFW/glfw3.h)
 - glm

# Limitations

 Sketch must have setup() and draw() functions 

# Credits

I use this repos for modernize my library
