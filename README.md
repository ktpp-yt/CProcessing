# CProcessing

Just processing, but in C++   
Most sketches are compatible, but library not fully ported   
Uses own OpenGL 3.3 renderer (beta)  
Write and test in QtCreator, VIM, NeoVIM, VScode, Notepad and more...

 - OpenGL     
 - GLFW       
 - glm        
 - Freetype2  

### What's work

 - [x] Window making
 - [x] OpenGL making
 - [x] Drawing (partially)
   - [x] 2D
     - [x] Simple shapes 
     - [x] Complex shapes (via beginShape()/endShape()) 
     - [x] Textures/Images
   - [ ] 3D
     - [ ] Simple 3D shapes (Box,Sphere)
     - [ ] Textures/Images
   - [x] Font Rendering (beta)
 - [x] Input  (partially)
   - [x] Mouse input (almost DONE)
   - [x] Keyboard input (partially)
 - [ ] Output
